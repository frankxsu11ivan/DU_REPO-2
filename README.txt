# VBA of Wall Street
## Overview of Project 
The project overview of Module 2 Explored Programming Language using Visual Basic programming and interacting directly to Microsoft Excel
### Purpose
The Purpose is to begin understanding programming language and seeing automated results in work sheet.
## Analysis and Challenges
	Challenges are structured around charting the analysis and popups asking what worksheet were to be activated.
	The data set was given and consisted of data to run Visual Basic. 
The challenge is working through the code to run complex analyses as I was deconstructing the problem and debugging. The challenge that i encountered were realizing when to close if loops inside for then loops.
### 2a Results
The challenge i had was getting to run and get to the results. With a bit of tenacity, the code was finally ready for 'F5'. 
As luck had it the challenge was the did not want to go further. Macros were not enabled.

The debugging was to cut out the code, check warnings and ‘F5’. I received a hello world.
![verify code works 'hello world'](C:\Users\Frank.sullivan\Desktop\GitFolder\Challenges\Resources\verify code works 'hello world' )

## 2b Results
Cleaning up and debugging through ‘F5’ I was able to get to verify what year. I had left in my notation to track where I am with the code to go backwards if needed.
 

### Analysis of 2017 to 2018 Stock 
2017 had a better year with only ‘TERP” Ticker in the red at -7.9%. 
 
The same stock the next year tanked. They should have sold short in 2017 and bought in 2018 as the stock sale was on (depressed price).
 
### Refactoring code.
Refactoring the code helped me look harder at what was written. Noted when I <> I was when the ticker would stop at the local loop. That was the breaking through moment. Refactoring for speed would help if I had confidence on the data to run through. Quicker? Well possibly over more data as the run time decreased.
 

### 3 Summary 
Refactoring the Module2_VBA_Script helped the code. I cleaned out  (#edited) various steps from the module – as I had used this module for the exercises. It helped to back check and get to ‘Hello World’. I am not able to tell if the code worked more efficiently as VBA felt clunky. The best debugging tool is F5 and running.
